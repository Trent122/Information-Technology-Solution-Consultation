This ReadMe is an introduction to Information Technology Solution Consultation of Bloctec

Blocktec understands that not every client need can be solved with a blockchain/decentralized-based solution. Thus, following the evaluation of the project in its current state, Blocktec provides a recommendation for project/product/application development and a roadmap going forward, based on the value propositions presented for each option (i.e. value proposition for traditional database vs. blockchain-based solution).

Blocktec has partnered with Companies experienced in non-blockchain related IT work, to ensure we can provide a seamless and full-stack solution  without hindering the progress of the project. Said differently, if your problem can be solved with IT solutions (blockchain or not), we can provide the expertise and resources no matter the niche.
